# PUBLICITY: systems-languages-lab (P21)

Publicity log under the documentation and publishing standard,
Section 7. Every finished level produces its written fan-out set,
each piece graded on the 1,000-point publicity rubric (accuracy 300,
research 200, gap fit 200, clarity 150, reach format 150), ship line
900. Drafts are prepared by the loop. Actual social posting follows
the standing platform rules and gates. The loop itself never posts
to social.

Project state: v1.0, Learn, Build, and Deep done 2026-11-05,
46 checks passing plus the scaffold smoke test. Level grades on
record: Learn 7,900 of 10,000, Build 7,800 of 10,000,
Deep 7,900 of 10,000. Every executed level is a Python reference
only: Go and Rust sources are UNEXECUTED at every level, the
toolchains were missing on the build VM, all probes and manifests
are scripted fixtures, and the Deep speedup is an order of
magnitude effect, not a constant.

## Actions polish pack (2026-11-05)

Applied through a pull request on 2026-11-05, following the Actions
polish pack standard. The pack adds: CI on a Python 3.11 and 3.12
matrix with a ruff lint step (the pre-existing CI steps preserved:
scaffold smoke test; plus per-level test and runner steps for Learn,
Build, and Deep, following the proven pack pattern), CodeQL
scanning, Dependabot for pip and GitHub Actions, a release workflow
that attaches a source tarball named
systems-languages-lab-<tag>.tar.gz to v* tag releases, Labeler,
Greetings (snake_case inputs for actions/first-interaction@v3:
repo_token, issue_message, pr_message), Stale in comment-only mode
(days-before-close: -1, never closes), and a docs summary page at
docs/index.md for GitHub Pages. Ruff scope is recorded in
ruff.toml (E, F, I, line-length 120). Ruff fixes in this pull
request were style only: 25 initial errors (12 E402 sibling imports
fixed with noqa markers, 12 E501 long lines wrapped or expanded with
no change to any value, 1 I001 import format fixed by ruff fix),
with no change to behaviour, to any imported name that is used, or
to any string value. Learn and Build results files stayed
byte-identical across the runners; the Deep results file differs
only in its timing section across runs by design, and its
timing-only diff was restored, so no results file changes in this
pull request. requirements.txt records the
standard-library-only fact for the executed Python (Go and Rust
unexecuted) so Dependabot pip has a manifest to watch.

| Channel | Outcome on 2026-11-05 |
| --- | --- |
| GitHub Pages | Docs page added at docs/index.md in this pull request. Pages enablement and live build status are verified after merge and recorded in the batch ledger; no live claim is made in this file before that check. |
| PyPI publishing | Held: needs a PyPI token, a new credential. Jesun's tap only. Not set up. |
| Social channels (LinkedIn, X, Facebook, Instagram, Threads) | Held: no posts made. The loop never posts to social; Threads waits for Jesun's tap per post under the standing gates. |

Publicity grade for this polish pack log piece, on the 1,000
point rubric (accuracy 300, research 200, gap fit 200, clarity
150, reach format 150), ship line 900:

| Piece | Accuracy /300 | Research /200 | Gap fit /200 | Clarity /150 | Reach /150 | Total /1000 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| PUBLICITY.md polish pack section (2026-11-05) | 295 | 180 | 195 | 145 | 95 | 910 |

At or above the 900 ship line. Named deductions: research minus
20, because the pack is a standard applied across repos and this
section records its application rather than new research; reach
minus 55, because the docs page is copy in this pull request with
no live Pages claim yet, PyPI publishing is held, and no social
channel carries this piece by the standing gates; accuracy minus
5, gap fit minus 5, and clarity minus 5 for summary compression
of the full pack standard, which lives in the batch files.

## v1.0 fan-out set (2026-11-05)

Written fan-out set prepared in this cycle, in fanout/. Every
piece states plainly that Go and Rust sources are UNEXECUTED
at every level, every executed level is a Python reference
only, all health probes and tool manifests are scripted
fixtures, and the Deep speedup is an order of magnitude
effect, not a constant. Every number is sourced from the repo
files (README.md, DOSSIER.md, the three level READMEs, and
the three results files). Tutorial commands were verified by
running them; the full suite (46 checks plus the scaffold
smoke test) passes, Learn and Build results files stayed
byte-identical across the runners, and the Deep results file
differs only in its timing section across runs by design, with
its timing-only diff restored.

Overall fan-out grade: 9,452 of 10,000 (the mean of the six
piece grades below, scaled to 10,000: 5,671 of 6,000).

Jev claim_check on the blog main results claim (extracted byte
exact from fanout/blog-post.md by script): model jev-1.13.0,
699 input tokens, 20 output tokens, question id supported,
noul 0.82, route REVIEW (claim_check bands: clear at 0.85 or
above, block at 0.10 or below, review between). Spec and
results are in the goal hidden_files
(jev-p21-fanout-claim-spec-2026-11-05.json and
jev-p21-fanout-claim-results-2026-11-05.json).

| Repo (tutorial) | Tutorial draft | fanout/tutorial.md, repo draft. Every command verified by running it in this cycle. |
| Repo (website) | Website page copy draft | fanout/website-page.md, copy only. No website was changed by this file. |
| LinkedIn | Post draft | fanout/linkedin-post.md, DRAFT NOT POSTED. Held: posting follows the standing platform rules; the link is carried as the first-comment line in the draft, per the LinkedIn rule. |
| Paper | Candidate brief | fanout/paper-candidate.md. Submission is Jesun's tap; nothing submitted, no venue contacted. |
| Repo (release notes) | Release notes | fanout/release-notes.md, covering v0.1, v0.5, and v1.0 with Python reference results and release links verified with gh release list. |
| X | Social post | Held: no post made. The loop never posts to social; drafts only under the standing platform rules. |
| Facebook | Social post | Held: no post made. Standing Facebook rule applies (no link in body or comments, keyword call to action by DM) and the loop never posts to social. |
| Instagram | Social post | Held: no post made. Standing Instagram rule applies (link in bio) and the loop never posts to social. |
| Threads | Social post | Held: awaiting Jesun's tap. Every Threads post needs his one-tap pre-approval, hash-locked on exact text and media. |
| Video | 3D playbook video | Held: flagship video production runs through the January engine queue. No video produced in this cycle. |
| Book | Book chapter | Held: chapter drafted from finished projects under the journey publishing plan; no chapter file is claimed in this cycle. |

Per-piece publicity grades, on the 1,000-point rubric (accuracy
300, research 200, gap fit 200, clarity 150, reach format 150),
ship line 900:

| Piece | Accuracy /300 | Research /200 | Gap fit /200 | Clarity /150 | Reach /150 | Total /1000 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| fanout/blog-post.md | 295 | 183 | 195 | 143 | 137 | 953 |
| fanout/tutorial.md | 298 | 184 | 195 | 148 | 135 | 960 |
| fanout/website-page.md | 295 | 174 | 190 | 145 | 140 | 944 |
| fanout/linkedin-post.md | 290 | 168 | 190 | 143 | 145 | 936 |
| fanout/paper-candidate.md | 293 | 186 | 190 | 140 | 123 | 932 |
| fanout/release-notes.md | 298 | 182 | 186 | 145 | 135 | 946 |
| PUBLICITY.md fan-out section (this section) | 295 | 175 | 190 | 145 | 130 | 935 |

All six fan-out pieces are at or above the 900 ship line. Named
deductions: accuracy loses 2 to 10 per piece for summary
compression of the level READMEs (the full method, oracle, and
per-object tables live in the level folders, not in the fan-out
pieces); research loses 14 to 32 per piece because the fan-out
reports measured repo work and names prior art from DOSSIER.md
and NOVELTY.md rather than adding new external research, and
the paper brief names no venue and records that the SPEC
records no paper angle for this project; gap fit loses 5 to 15
per piece because the unexecuted Go and Rust tracks cap how
far any piece can speak to real systems language roles;
clarity loses 2 to 10 per piece for the repeated unexecuted
and scripted fixture lines, which are mandatory honesty and
cost reading flow; reach loses 5 to 27 per piece because every
social channel is held under the standing gates, the paper is
an unsubmitted brief, and no live website or blog publication
exists yet, so reach is draft reach, not published reach.
